Hi! I'm Bohan HU, a first-year Ph.D. student from Microelectronics Thrust, Function Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of [Prof. Jiang XU](https://eexu.home.ece.ust.hk).

I'm feeling lucky to be in the "golden decades" of computer architecture research and have been self-motivated to explore technologies in microprocessors as well as novel architectures.

Besides computer architecture, I enjoy Rock music, and I'm a big fan of the alternative rock band "Omnipotent Youth Society."
